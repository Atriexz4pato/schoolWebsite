                    In Enlight, co-curricular activities complement the
                    academic curriculum and provide students with opportunities to explore their interests, develop new
                    skills, and foster personal growth outside of traditional classroom learning. These activities are
                    usually organized and supervised by teachers or staff members and can include a wide range of
                    options to cater to different interests and talents among students.</p>
